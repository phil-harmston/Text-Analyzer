# Text-Analyzer
Text Analyzer for web or text files

Text Analyzer is my final project for the ed2go python course online.
this project demonstrates most things learned during the course and sums the
course up nicely.

A couple of notes about this project
1.)This is not an actively maintained project and once submitted for a grade
will no longer be maintained.  This module should not be used in production unless
the user is willing to completely test and maintain the project.

2.)I am sure there are better ways to complete some of the code in this project
but it was more important to get it working than to make it fast.
on function takes almost a minute to complete if there is a better way to do This
by all means go ahead.  

3.) If you are looking to use this code for the same project please don't. Please do your
own work.  

4.) lastly this could be cleaned up and made easier to read
and I may do that but for now it is what it is.
